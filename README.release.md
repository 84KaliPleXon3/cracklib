Release Process
===============

During development, version/tags/etc. should reflect version "2.9.x" for example

At time of release, create ONE commit with all version numbers update in files and named for example "X.X.X".
Create a tag of the name "cracklib-X.Y.Z" pointed to that commit and produce releases at that point

Before publication, you can add in NEWS for example "2.9.x" or "master" or "dev" and only when it is the commit
for announcement, the moment to change the new version.

After the release, when you add improvement in the code, "2.9.x" or "master" or "dev", do not mark with next version
number to avoid future confusion.
